This assignment was to create a responsive personal portfolio webpage with a Contact, About and Portfolio page. I utilized HTML, CSS and Bootstrap components to create, style and ensure responsiveness to multiple screen types and sizes. The portfolio is an introduction with a small about page and links to my social media profiles. At this time the portfolio has only placeholder images.

The site is deployed at the following link: https://jordanmorse.github.io/firstportfolio/
